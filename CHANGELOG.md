---

## [**1.1.9**] - 2021-02-23

### Fixed

* Removed paces at the beginning, or the end of the minified code.
* Dependency errors by updating them

## [**1.1.8**] - 2020-09-02

### Fixed

* Issue #49. A px number with a sign which ends with 0 was appended with 0px. ex: +1200px to +1200px0px

## [**1.1.7**] - 2020-09-01

### Fixed

* 00px was always transformed to 0px. So 1200px would be minified to 120px. It is fixed now, as MinifyAll searches if the previous character is a number or not.

## [**1.1.6**] - 2020-08-31

### Fixed

* Issue 45. MinifyAll now supports CSS calc operations.

### Added

* Issue label bot yaml in the .github directory.

## [**1.1.5**] - 2020-07-23

### Fixed

* Issue #43 (JSON minifier was removing a space after a comma).

### Improved

* Multiple other JSON improvements to try to remove the more spaces possible without removing spaces inside a text string.

### Added

* Test file to only test JSON/C code.


## [**1.1.4**] - 2020-07-16

### Added

* Tests case to test the showVersion and showHelp arguments (informationalArguments.test.ts).
